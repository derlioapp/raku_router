# raku_router

A tiny, **code-generation-free**, UI-agnostic router for Flutter.

**[📖 Documentation](https://derlioapp.github.io/raku_router/) · [▶ Live demo](https://derlioapp.github.io/raku_router/live-demo/)**

The design goals come from one observation: every router pushes navigation
complexity *somewhere* — `go_router` into redirects/shells, `auto_route` into a
build step, Navigator 2.0 onto you. Raku's bet is that for most apps the
real need is modest, and a small reactive core beats a big framework.

- **Type-safe, no codegen.** Routes are plain `sealed` classes. An exhaustive
  `switch` is your route table. No `build_runner`, no `.gr.dart`, no annotations.
- **Nested navigation built in.** Each tab/branch gets its own persistent back
  stack — the thing `StatefulShellRoute` does, but by default.
- **Deep linking is opt-in and toggleable.** One call turns it on; omit it and
  the URL/Router machinery is never built. Default: off.
- **No state-management or design-system dependency.** The core only needs
  `flutter`. You inject the pages/transitions, so it drops into Material,
  Cupertino, or a custom design system equally.

> Pre-`1.0`: the public API has had its **1.0 freeze review** — the surface is
> trimmed to what apps use, value types are `final`, and URL handling is
> hardened. What remains before `1.0` is field validation, not churn. See the
> [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

## Mental model

```
RakuRoute        // your route = immutable data (sealed class)
   │
RouteStack           // a reactive List<route> (ValueListenable) — push/pop/replace
   │
RouteStackView       // renders a stack as a Navigator (+ optional system-back)
   │
BranchedRouteStack   // many stacks (tabs), one active — nested navigation
   │
raku(routes: […]) // a declarative route tree: a URL's structure ⇄ the stack
```

## Quick start (no deep linking)

```dart
sealed class AppRoute extends RakuRoute {
  const AppRoute();
}
class Home extends AppRoute { const Home(); }
class NoteDetail extends AppRoute {
  const NoteDetail(this.id);
  final String id;
  @override
  List<Object?> get props => [id];
}

final stack = RouteStack(const Home());

MaterialApp(
  home: RouteStackView(
    stack: stack,
    builder: (context, route) => switch (route as AppRoute) {
      Home()                => const HomeScreen(),
      NoteDetail(:final id) => NoteScreen(id: id),
    },
  ),
);
```

Navigate from anywhere below the view — no constructors to thread:

```dart
final stack = RouteStackScope.of(context);
stack.push(const NoteDetail('42'));
stack.pop();
```

## Nested tabs (persistent back stacks)

```dart
final tabs = BranchedRouteStack(branches: [
  RouteBranch(id: 'feed',     initial: const FeedTab()),
  RouteBranch(id: 'settings', initial: const SettingsTab()),
]);

Scaffold(
  body: BranchedStackView(controller: tabs, builder: buildScreen),
  bottomNavigationBar: ListenableBuilder(
    listenable: tabs,
    builder: (_, __) => BottomNavigationBar(
      currentIndex: tabs.index,
      onTap: (i) => tabs.index = i,
      items: const [...],
    ),
  ),
);
```

Switching tabs preserves each tab's stack. Each branch handles the system back
gesture for its own stack.

## Guards & redirects

```dart
class Editor extends AppRoute with RouteGuard {
  const Editor();
  @override
  bool get canPop => !hasUnsavedChanges; // false blocks the pop (read synchronously)
}

class LegacyNote extends AppRoute with RouteRedirect {
  const LegacyNote(this.id);
  final String id;
  @override
  RakuRoute redirect() => NoteDetail(id); // resolved before it's shown
}
```

Redirect chains are followed and **loop-protected** by the package — you don't
have to hand-write the "am I already going there?" check.

A guard vetoes **every** way of leaving the screen — the back gesture, the
system back button, `context.pop()`, and on the web the browser's back/forward
buttons (the address bar is put back). An explicit `go` (below) is an app
decision and isn't vetoed.

## Deep linking — one declarative route tree

Declare each screen's URL **once** in a tree of `route(...)` (and `tabs(...)`)
nodes. A URL's *structure* rebuilds the navigation stack: a deep link to
`/feed/notes/42` produces `[Feed, Note(42)]`, so **back returns to Feed** — the
web-grade behaviour, with no hand-written `pathSegments` parsing, no manual URL
building, and no code generation. The path's `:params` arrive typed via your
constructor — never `params['id']`.

```dart
final router = raku(
  initial: const Home(),
  routes: [
    route('/', (_) => const Home(), (_) => const HomeScreen(), children: [
      // /notes/:id — nested, so it stacks on top of Home.
      route('notes/:id', (p) => Note(p('id')), (n) => NoteScreen(id: n.id)),
    ]),
  ],
);

MaterialApp.router(routerConfig: router);
```

Navigate with typed objects — `context.push(const Note('42'))` — and the address
bar updates itself; a link to `/notes/42` opens `NoteScreen('42')`. Pages animate
with the premium `RakuTransitions.slideIn` by default (override with
`transition:`, or `RakuTransitions.none` to disable).

A single-prop path round-trips automatically. For a URL with **more than one
`:param`**, or one that carries **`?query`** state, give the node an `encode:` —
the inverse of `parse`, so route → URL stays exact:

```dart
route('/orgs/:org/members/:id',
    (p) => Member(p('org'), p('id')), (m) => MemberScreen(m),
    encode: (m) => RoutePath({'org': m.org, 'id': m.id}));

route('/search', (p) => Search(p.query('q') ?? ''), (s) => SearchScreen(s),
    encode: (s) => RoutePath(const {}, query: {'q': s.term}));
```

### Navigating from anywhere

`raku(...)` returns a `RakuRouter`. Besides being the `routerConfig`, it's your
navigation handle for code that has no `BuildContext` — a push-notification
handler, an auth listener, a service:

```dart
final router = raku(initial: const Home(), routes: [...]);

router.go(const Dashboard());   // rebuild the location, like a deep link
router.push(const Note('42'));  // push at the right level (tab or full-page)
router.current;                 // ValueListenable<RakuRoute> — the active leaf
router.routeOf(uri);            // URL → typed route, or null (never throws)
```

`go` is the "reset" navigation: the whole location is rebuilt from the route's
URL (its ancestors become the back stack, the right tab is selected), after
following redirects. Use it after sign-in / sign-out, or to open a notification
with a sensible back stack. From a widget, `context.go(route)` does the same.

```dart
onNotificationTap((String payload) {
  final route = router.routeOf(Uri.tryParse(payload) ?? Uri());
  if (route != null) router.go(route); // unknown links are simply ignored
});
```

For analytics or logging, pass `onNavigation:` — it reports the active route as a
typed object (not a raw `Route<dynamic>`) on every change, including browser
back/forward:

```dart
raku(initial: const Home(), routes: [...],
    onNavigation: (route) => analytics.screen(route.name));
```

For packages that want a raw `NavigatorObserver` (`FirebaseAnalyticsObserver`,
`SentryNavigatorObserver`, a `RouteObserver` for `RouteAware` widgets), pass
`observers:`. It's a **factory**, not a list — Raku builds several navigators
(the root plus one per tab branch) and a single observer instance can attach to
only one, so the factory is called once per navigator to give each fresh
instances (this way an observer sees in-tab pushes, not just top-level ones):

```dart
raku(initial: const Home(), routes: [...],
    observers: () => [FirebaseAnalyticsObserver(analytics: analytics)]);
```

**Tabs** are a node: `tabs(shell: ..., branches: [...])`. A route inside a branch
navigates **within its tab** (the shell stays put, only the content animates); a
`route(...)` at the top level (a sibling of the `tabs(...)` node) is **full-page**
above the shell. `context.push(route)` lands at the right level automatically, and
tabs nest arbitrarily. See `example/`.

```dart
final router = raku(
  initial: const Feed(),
  routes: [
    tabs(
      shell: (context, tabs, child) => Scaffold(
        body: child,
        bottomNavigationBar: NavigationBar(
          selectedIndex: tabs.index,
          onDestinationSelected: tabs.go,
          destinations: const [/* ... */],
        ),
      ),
      branches: [
        [route('/feed', (_) => const Feed(), (_) => const FeedScreen())],
        [route('/settings', (_) => const Settings(), (_) => const SettingsScreen())],
      ],
    ),
    route('/photo/:id', (p) => Photo(p('id')), (n) => PhotoScreen(id: n.id)),
  ],
);
```

## Not found (catch-all)

A trailing `*` is a **catch-all**: a typed 404 for any URL a concrete route
doesn't claim. Nest it under a section for a **subtree-scoped** not-found (it
shows inside that tab, stacked on the section root, so *back* returns there);
put it at the **top level** for a global one. The most specific catch-all wins,
a concrete route always beats a wildcard, and if a section defines none the URL
falls through to the nearest catch-all above it (or to `onUnknown`, if you'd
rather handle it outside the tree):

```dart
raku(
  initial: const Feed(),
  routes: [
    tabs(shell: ..., branches: [
      [route('/feed', (_) => const Feed(), (_) => const FeedScreen(), children: [
        route('notes/:id', (p) => Note(p('id')), (n) => NoteScreen(id: n.id)),
        // /feed/anything-else → the feed section's own 404, inside the tab.
        route('*', (p) => FeedMissing(p.rest), (n) => MissingScreen(n.path)),
      ])],
      [route('/settings', (_) => const Settings(), (_) => const SettingsScreen())],
    ]),
    // Anything matched by no section (e.g. /nope, /settings/x) → global 404.
    route('*', (p) => NotFound(p.rest), (n) => NotFoundScreen(n.path)),
  ],
);
```

The unmatched tail arrives typed via `p.rest` (e.g. `garbage/x`), and a
catch-all route round-trips like any other — so the 404's URL is preserved and
shareable, not rewritten.

## Transitions

Every page defaults to the premium `RakuTransitions.slideIn` — `raku(...)`,
`RouteStackView`, `BranchedStackView`, and `RakuPage` alike. Set `transition:`
to change it globally, `RakuTransitions.none` to disable, or
`route(..., transition: ...)` per node.

```dart
route('/sheet', (_) => const Sheet(), (_) => const SheetScreen(),
    transition: RakuTransitions.slideIn(from: SlideFrom.bottom));
```

`RakuTransitions` ships `none`, `fade`, `slide`, `riseUp`, and the
parametric `slideIn` — all Material/Cupertino-free.

## Web

`raku(...)` is a standard Navigator 2.0 `RouterConfig`, so the browser's
address bar and **back/forward buttons drive it for free** — each typed
navigation updates the URL, and a back/forward delivers the previous URL, which
the router reconciles **in place**: you land on the right screen with the other
tabs' history and unchanged screens' state intact (not a rebuilt-from-scratch
tree).

raku_router stays dependency-free, so the **URL strategy is yours to pick** — call
it once in `main()` before `runApp`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_web_plugins/url_strategy.dart';

void main() {
  usePathUrlStrategy(); // clean paths (/feed/notes/42) instead of the hash (/#/…)
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

Omit it for the default hash strategy. Either way the same route tree resolves;
for clean paths your host must serve `index.html` for unknown routes (SPA
fallback), the usual single-page-app deploy step.

### Route → URL (links & sharing)

`raku(...)` returns a `RakuRouter` — a `RouterConfig` that also exposes the
route tree's *reverse* direction. Turn a typed route into its URL for a share
link, a deep link, or an `<a href>`:

```dart
final router = raku(initial: const Home(), routes: [...]);

router.hrefOf(const Note('42')); // '/feed/notes/42'
router.uriOf(const Search('shoes')); // Uri: /search?q=shoes
```

It's built by the same tree that parses URLs, so it always stays in sync — no
second, hand-written "route to path" function to drift. (This is the app-internal
location; under the default hash strategy an actual anchor's `href` is that value
after a `#`.)

### Browser tab titles

Give a node a `title:` to set the browser tab (and Android task-switcher) label
while that route is the active leaf. Derive it from the route so detail pages
read well:

```dart
route('notes/:id', (p) => Note(p('id')), (n) => NoteScreen(id: n.id),
    title: (n) => 'Note ${n.id}');
```

Give `raku(title: ...)` a fallback for the routes that declare none — otherwise
leaving a titled route for an untitled one keeps the old label:

```dart
raku(initial: const Home(), routes: [...], title: (_) => 'My App');
```

Opt-in: if no route declares a title and there's no fallback, the platform is
never called.

### URL matching rules

- Matching is **case-sensitive** (`/Notes/1` doesn't match `notes/:id`).
- A trailing slash and doubled slashes are ignored (`/notes/1/` = `/notes/1`).
- The `#fragment` is ignored and not round-tripped.
- A repeated query key keeps its **last** value (`?q=a&q=b` → `b`).
- Params are percent-decoded on the way in and re-encoded on the way out.

**URLs are untrusted input** — anyone can send your app a deep link. A URL
that matches nothing, isn't valid percent-encoding, or makes your `parse` throw
(`p.asInt('id')` on `/notes/abc`) never crashes the app: that route just
doesn't match, so the URL falls through to a catch-all `route('*', …)` or to
`onUnknown`. Still treat the typed values as untrusted in your screens, as you
would form input.

### Transient URL state (no history spam)

`context.replaceSilently(route)` updates the address bar **in place** — no new
history entry, so back/forward skips it. Use it for URL state that should be
shareable and restorable but shouldn't clutter history: a search query, an active
filter, a within-page selection.

```dart
onChanged: (q) => context.replaceSilently(Search(q)), // one history entry, not one per keystroke
```

It wraps Flutter's `Router.neglect`; outside a deep-linked app (no Router, no URL)
it degrades to a plain `replace`.

## State restoration

Because `raku(...)` is a standard `RouterConfig`, the **navigation location
is restored across process death** for free — just give `MaterialApp.router` a
`restorationScopeId`:

```dart
MaterialApp.router(restorationScopeId: 'app', routerConfig: router);
```

Flutter saves the current `RouteInformation` and re-feeds it to a fresh delegate
on restart, which **reconstructs the stack from the URL** — so a user who is
killed deep in the app returns to the same screen (the active path; inactive tabs
restore to their initial route, as with a cold link). Verified end-to-end with
`restartAndRestore`.

For a *screen* to restore its own widget state (a half-typed form, scroll
offset), use Flutter's `RestorationMixin` in that screen and give its page a
`restorationId` via a custom `pageBuilder` — the hook is plumbed through
`RakuPage`.

## What it intentionally does *not* do

- **The URL encodes the active path, not every tab's divergent history.** A URL's
  structure rebuilds the active stack and resolves the right tab; a *cold* deep
  link starts the other tabs at their initial route — a single URL can't carry
  every branch's history (no router can). **Within a session, though, inactive
  tabs and the element state of unchanged screens are preserved** across both
  in-app navigation *and* browser back/forward: the router reconciles the live
  tree in place rather than rebuilding it.
- No animation library; bring your own `RouteTransitionsBuilder` for fancy ones.

These are deliberate omissions for a small core, not oversights.

## Navigation results

Raku does **not** thread a result back through an awaited `push`/`pop` (the
`showDialog`-style `Navigator.push<T>() → await`). Navigation here is
declarative — the stack is data — so a "picked value" flows back the way any
other state does, not through the navigation call. Two idioms:

```dart
// 1. A callback carried on the route (immutable, so keep it out of `props`).
class PickColor extends AppRoute {
  const PickColor(this.onPicked);
  final ValueChanged<Color> onPicked;
  @override
  List<Object?> get props => const []; // identity, not the callback
}
// Opener:  context.push(PickColor((color) => setState(() => picked = color)));
// Picker:  route.onPicked(color); context.pop();  // the opener reacts

// 2. Shared state the opener already listens to (a ValueNotifier, signal, …).
context.push(const PickColor2()); // picker writes selection.value; opener rebuilds
```

For a plain dialog that genuinely wants an awaited value, use
`showDialog<T>()` — it composes fine (see below); Raku owns *page* navigation,
not every ephemeral overlay.

## Auth: a login guard

Model "must be signed in" as a `RouteRedirect`. Because `redirect()` returns a
`FutureOr`, it can await your auth state; a deep link into a protected route
resolves the redirect *before* the screen is shown, exactly like an in-app push:

```dart
class Account extends AppRoute with RouteRedirect {
  const Account();
  @override
  FutureOr<RakuRoute?> redirect() async =>
      await auth.isSignedIn() ? null : const Login(from: Account());
}

class Login extends AppRoute {
  const Login({this.from});
  final RakuRoute? from; // where to return after a successful sign-in
  @override
  List<Object?> get props => [from];
}
// On success: context.go(from ?? const Home());
```

The loop protection is built in — a redirect chain that would spin is stopped
for you.

**Protect a whole section with one redirect.** A deep link rebuilds the entire
ancestor chain, and every redirect along it applies, so guarding the section
root guards everything below it: with `Admin` redirecting signed-out users, a
link to `/admin/users/1` lands on `Login` too.

**Sign-out** — redirects run when a route is *entered*, so react to the auth
change by navigating:

```dart
auth.addListener(() {
  if (!auth.isSignedIn) router.go(const Login());
});
// After a successful sign-in: context.go(from ?? const Home());
```

## Dialogs & bottom sheets

`showDialog` / `showModalBottomSheet` are imperative `Navigator.push`es, and they
live happily alongside a Raku stack — the view syncs itself. When the framework
removes a page you pushed imperatively (a barrier tap, an imperative `pop`), Raku
hears it via `Navigator.onDidRemovePage` and keeps its stack consistent, so a
later system-back still pops the *page* you expect.

```dart
final choice = await showModalBottomSheet<String>(context: context, builder: ...);
if (choice != null) context.push(NoteDetail(choice)); // page nav stays declarative
```

System back closes an open dialog or sheet **first** — whether it sits on the
root navigator or on a tab's — and only the next back pops the page under it.

Rule of thumb: **pages** (addressable, deep-linkable, in the back stack) are
routes; **overlays** (dialogs, sheets, menus, snackbars) stay imperative.

## Testing your navigation

The reactive core is a plain object — assert on it with no widgets at all:

```dart
final stack = RouteStack(const Home());
stack.push(const NoteDetail('42'));
expect(stack.current, const NoteDetail('42'));
expect(stack.value, [const Home(), const NoteDetail('42')]);
```

For the deep-link router, drive the `RouterConfig` the way the platform does —
parse a URL, feed it to the delegate, and pump:

```dart
final router = raku(initial: const Home(), routes: [...]);
await tester.pumpWidget(MaterialApp.router(routerConfig: router));

final loc = await router.routeInformationParser!
    .parseRouteInformation(RouteInformation(uri: Uri.parse('/feed/notes/42')));
await router.routerDelegate.setNewRoutePath(loc);
await tester.pumpAndSettle();
expect(find.text('Note 42'), findsOneWidget);
expect(router.routerDelegate.currentConfiguration, const Note('42'));
```

`popRoute()` exercises the system back button; `router.hrefOf(route)` checks the
reverse (route → URL) direction. See this package's own `test/` for guard,
redirect, tabs, restoration, and 404 examples.

## Migrating from go_router

The concepts line up almost one-to-one; the difference is that destinations are
typed objects, not string paths.

| go_router | raku_router |
| --- | --- |
| `GoRoute(path, builder)` | `route(path, parse, screen)` |
| `GoRoute(routes: [...])` (nested) | `route(..., children: [...])` |
| `StatefulShellRoute` / `ShellRoute` | `tabs(shell:, branches:)` |
| `redirect:` | `with RouteRedirect` (per route — covers its subtree — loop-protected) |
| `refreshListenable:` | listen to your auth state, then `router.go(...)` |
| `errorBuilder` / `onException` | catch-all `route('*', …)` or `onUnknown:` |
| `context.go(uri)` | `context.go(route)` / `router.go(route)` (typed) |
| `context.push(uri)` | `context.push(route)` / `router.push(route)` |
| `context.replace(uri)` | `context.replace(route)` / `replaceSilently` |
| `state.pathParameters['id']` | typed constructor via `parse` (`p('id')`) |
| `GoRouterState.uri` | `router.uriOf(route)` (reverse) |
| `GoRouter.of(context).state` | `router.current` (a `ValueListenable`) |
| `observers:` | `observers:` (a factory — see above) |
| `.gr.dart` / `build_runner` | nothing — plain `sealed` classes |

The mechanical part of a migration is turning each `GoRoute`'s string
destination into a `sealed` route class and moving its `state.pathParameters`
reads into the constructor.

## Versioning & deprecation policy

Raku follows semantic versioning, with one pre-1.0 clarification:

- **`0.x`** — the API is settling. New capability lands additively (a `0.2.0`,
  `0.3.0`, …). A breaking change, if one proves necessary, ships in a **minor**
  bump with a `CHANGELOG` migration note.
- **`1.0.0`** — a *stability* release, not a feature one: the surface reviewed
  here becomes a compatibility promise.
- **After `1.0`** — breaking changes only on a **major** bump. Anything being
  removed is first marked `@Deprecated` with a pointer to its replacement and
  kept for at least one minor release, so you always have a non-breaking upgrade
  path.

## Why not just use go_router / auto_route?

Use them if you want the ecosystem and don't mind their trade-offs. Reach for
Raku when you want navigation that is *yours*: a couple hundred lines you can
read in one sitting, no code generation, and no dependency creep into your state
or UI layers.
